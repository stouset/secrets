///
/// A type for protecting fixed-length secrets allocated on the heap.
///
/// Heap-allocated secrets have distinct security needs from
/// stack-allocated ones. They provide the following guarantees:
///
/// * any attempt to access the memory without having been borrowed
///   appropriately will result in immediate program termination; the
///   memory is protected with [`mprotect(2)`][mprotect] as follows:
///   * [`PROT_NONE`][mprotect] when the [`SecretBox`] has no
///     outstanding borrows
///   * [`PROT_READ`][mprotect] when it has outstanding immutable
///     borrows
///   * [`PROT_WRITE`][mprotect] when it has an outstanding mutable
///     borrow
/// * the allocated region has guard pages preceding and following
///   it—both set to [`PROT_NONE`][mprotect]—ensuring that overflows and
///   (large enough) underflows cause immediate program termination
/// * a canary is placed just before the memory location (and after the
///   guard page) in order to detect smaller underflows; if this memory
///   has been written to (and the canary modified), the program will
///   immediately abort when the [`SecretBox`] is [`drop`](Drop)ped
/// * [`mlock(2)`][mlock] is called on the underlying memory
/// * [`munlock(2)`][mlock] is called on the underlying memory when no longer in use
/// * the underlying memory is zeroed when no longer in use
/// * they are best-effort compared in constant time
/// * they are best-effort prevented from being printed by [`Debug`].
/// * they are best-effort protected from [`Clone`]ing the interior data
///
/// To fulfill these guarantees, [`SecretBox`] uses an API similar to
/// (but not exactly like) that of [`RefCell`][refcell]. You must call
/// [`borrow`](SecretBox::borrow) to (immutably) borrow the protected
/// data inside and you must call [`borrow_mut`](SecretBox::borrow_mut)
/// to access it mutably. Unlike [`RefCell`][refcell] which hides
/// interior mutability with immutable borrows, these two calls follow
/// standard borrowing rules: [`borrow_mut`](SecretBox::borrow_mut)
/// takes a `&mut self`, so the borrow checker statically ensures the
/// exclusivity of mutable borrows.
///
/// These [`borrow`](SecretBox::borrow) and
/// [`borrow_mut`](SecretBox::borrow_mut) calls return a wrapper around
/// the interior that ensures the memory is re-[`mprotect`][mprotect]ed
/// when all active borrows leave scope. These wrappers [`Deref`] to the
/// underlying value so you can to work with them as if they were the
/// underlying type, with a few excepitons: they have specific
/// implementations for [`Clone`], [`Debug`], [`PartialEq`], and [`Eq`]
/// that try to ensure that the underlying memory isn't copied out of
/// protected area, that the contents are never printed, and that two
/// secrets are only ever compared in constant time.
///
/// Care *must* be taken not to over-aggressively dereference these
/// wrappers, as once you're working with the real underlying type, we
/// can't prevent direct calls to their implementations of these traits.
/// Care must also be taken not to call any other methods on these types
/// that introduce copying.
///
/// # Example: generate a cryptographically-random 128-bit [`SecretBox`]
///
/// Initialize a [`SecretBox`] with cryptographically random data:
///
/// ```
/// # use secrets::SecretBox;
/// let secret = SecretBox::<u128>::random();
///
/// assert_eq!(secret.size(), 16);
/// ```
///
/// # Example: move mutable data into a [`SecretBox`]
///
/// Existing data can be moved into a [`SecretBox`]. When doing so, we
/// make a best-effort attempt to zero out the data in the original
/// location. Any prior copies will be unaffected, so please exercise as
/// much caution as possible when handling data before it can be
/// protected.
///
/// ```
/// # use secrets::SecretBox;
/// let mut value = 0x0011223344556677u128;
///
/// // the contents of `value` will be copied into the SecretBox before
/// // being zeroed out
/// let secret = SecretBox::from(&mut value);
///
/// // the contents of `value` have been zeroed
/// assert_eq!(value, 0);
/// ```
///
/// # Example: compilation failure from incompatible borrows
///
/// Unlike [`RefCell`][refcell], which hides interior mutability behind
/// immutable borrows, a [`SecretBox`] can't have an outstanding
/// [`borrow`](SecretBox::borrow) and
/// [`borrow_mut`](SecretBox::borrow_mut) at the same time.
///
/// ```compile_fail
/// # use secrets::SecretBox;
/// let mut secret   = SecretBox::<u32>::zero(8);
/// let     secret_r = secret.borrow();
///
/// // error[E0502]: cannot borrow `secret` as mutable because it is
/// // also borrowed as immutable
/// secret.borrow_mut();
/// ```
///
/// # Example: compilation failure from multiple mutable borrows
///
/// Unlike [`RefCell`][refcell], which hides interior mutability behind
/// immutable borrows, a [`SecretBox`] can't have multiple outstanding
/// [`borrow_mut`](SecretBox::borrow_mut)s at the same time.
///
/// ```compile_fail
